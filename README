This is strace 3.1, a system call tracer for SunOS 4.x, Linux, System
V release 4, Solaris 2.x and Irix 5.x.  strace is released under a
Berkeley-style license at the request of Paul Kranenburg; see the file
COPYRIGHT for details.

Read the INSTALL file for generic instructions on how to install
strace.  If configure cannot guess your system configuration, you can
specify it on the command line after the other options like this:

	./configure --prefix=/usr i486-linux

The following configurations are supposed to work (in porting order):

	sparc-sun-sunos4.1
	i486-linux
	sparc-sun-solaris2
	i486-ncr-sysv4
	i486-sun-solaris2
	m68k-linux
	mips-sgi-irix5
	alpha-linux

A single sunos4.1 binary should work on all the sun4, sun4c and sun4m
kernel architectures.  Let me know if sun4d doesn't work.  Other
i486-*-sysv4 systems may work with little or no tweaking.

See the file NEWS for information on what has changed in recent
versions.
