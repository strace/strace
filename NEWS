Changes in version 3.1
======================

* Irix5 is supported
* Linux 68k is supported
* Linux alpha is supported
* configure is upgraded to autoconf 2.x
* using -f in combination with -e now works correctly
* output can be piped to a program
* tracing setuid programs works better
* it is now reasonable to install strace setuid to root in some circumstances
* new useful tracing names like file and process to trace whole
  classes of system calls, e.g. -efile traces all system calls that
  take a file name as an argument
* IPC calls on SunOS 4.1.x are decoded
* Linux program memory is reliably dereferenced
* Linux decodes at least the name of all syscalls as of pre2.0.4
* various cosmetic changes and bug fixes

Changes from versions 2.x to version 3.0
========================================

* filename arguments are neither abbreviated nor stringified
* string arguments are now true C strings using octal instead of hex by default
* preprocessor constants are never shortened (e.g. was RDONLY => now O_RDONLY)
* by default the output for multiple processes now goes into one file
* all structures, vectors, bitsets, etc. use consistent output formats
* the -c option now means count calls, -i does what the old -c used to do

New Features in version 3.0
===========================

* non-ascii strings can be optionally printed entirely in hex
* the output format is readable when mutiple processes are generating output
* exit values are printed in an alignment column
* is is possible to suppress messages about attaching and detaching
* various tracing features can be enabled on a per syscall/signal/desc basis
* selective tracing of syscalls
* selective printing of syscall structures
* selective abbreviation of long structures on a per syscall basis
* selective printing of raw syscall arguments and results
* selective tracing of signals
* selective dumping of all I/O read from file descriptors
* selective dumping of all I/O written to file descriptors
* optional counting of time, calls, and errors for each syscall
