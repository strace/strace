Noteworthy changes in release 5.6 (2020-04-07)
==============================================

* Changes in behaviour
  * Messages about unknown tracees are now subject to the strace's quietness
    setting (-q/--quiet).
  * If -A option is provided without -o, or -S option without -c/-C, a warning
    about its uselessness is printed now.
  * The usage of --seccomp-bpf without -f has no effect now.

* Improvements
  * Every short option now has a long option alias, which also has enabled
    the following improvements:
    * Ability to use human-readable settings for -I/--interruptible,
      -D/--daemonize options.
    * Ability to silence specific messages using -e quiet/--quiet qualifier
      (an alias for the -q option), including those that couldn't be silenced
      previously (path resolution messages and "superseded by execve").
    * Ability to specify selected fd decoding features using
      -e decode-fds/--decode-fds qualifier (an alias for the -y option).
    * Ability to set precision for the absolute timestamp, relative timestamp,
      and syscall time output (using --absolute-timestamps,
      --relative-timestamps, and --syscall-times options, respectively).
  * Implemented ability to select the set of displayed columns in the call
    summary output (-U/--summary-columns option).

  * Fixed tests on alpha with Linux kernel headers 5.1+.

* Portability
  * Removed support for decoding syscalls in range [1024...1079] on AArch64

Noteworthy changes in release 5.2 (2019-07-12)
==============================================

* Improvements
  * Implemented syscall return status filtering with -e status=set option

    and V4L2_* constants.
  * Updated lists of ioctl commands from Linux 5.1.

Noteworthy changes in release 5.0 (2019-03-19)
==============================================

* Changes in behavior
  * -D option now implies -I4: by default strace ignores SIGHUP, SIGINT,
    SIGQUIT, SIGPIPE, SIGTERM, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP when -D option
    is used.
  * Diagnostic message is no longer printed if an attempt to restart a process
    has failed with ESRCH.  (Addresses RHBZ bug #1662936.)

    Amount of preceding zeroes printed for offset is now chosen in a way
    to accommodate all the digits of all the offsets being printed.

* Improvements
  * Changed the way tracees are handled: all pending tracees are now waited for
    before further processing, this improves fairness of tracee processing.
    (Addresses RHBZ bugs #478419, #526740, #851457, #1609318, #1610774,
    and maybe some others.)

===============================================

* Changes in behaviour
  * On x32 personality, 64-bit syscalls (such as readv) are now shown with "#64"
    suffix instead of "64:" prefix.  Unlike the old names, these new names
    can be used in syscall qualification expressions.
  * Changed error number output format: error numbers are consistently
    printed as "-1 ECONST (Error description)"
    for known errors and as "-1 (errno 123)" for unknown errors,
    regardless of -e raw qualification settings.  One can specify
    -X raw for displaying raw error numbers unconditionally.
  * Unfetchable addresses inside arrays are now printed as comments.
  * Obsolete IA-32 mode syscall names are no longer printed on ia64.

* Improvements
  * Implemented libdw backend for -k option, configured at build time
    using --with-libdw option.
    Whether -k option is compiled is now configured at build time
    using --enable-stacktrace option.
  * Added -X option for configuring xlat output formatting (addresses
    Debian bug #692915).
  * Added support for personality designation ("64", "32", or "x32") to syscall
    qualifications in -e trace expressions.
  * Implemented injection of syscalls with no side effects as an alternative
    to injection of an invalid syscall (-e inject=SET:syscall= expression).

  * Implemented decoding of BPF_PROG_QUERY and BPF_RAW_TRACEPOINT_OPEN bpf
    syscall commands.

    SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_*, SEGV_*, SEM_*, SHM_*, SW_*, V4L2_CID_*,

* Changes in infrastructure
  * The mailing list was moved to strace-devel@lists.strace.io.
  * SourceForge git repository
    (https://sourceforge.net/p/strace/code/ci/master/tree/) is no longer
    maintained.  Please use GitLab (https://gitlab.com/strace/strace/)
    or GitHub (https://github.com/strace/strace/) repository instead.

* Changes in behaviour
  * When printing string data, '8' and '9' following an octal escape sequence
    no longer lead to unabbreviated octal escape sequence output, as they used
    to do.
  * Angle brackets are now printed as octal number escape sequences
    in the output of paths associated with file descriptors.
  * Data dump for write syscalls (-e write) is performed regardless
    of successfulness of these syscall (addresses Debian bug #436284).
  * -r and -t options are now affect output independently.  Previously,
    -r option led to ignoring of the -t option (addresses Debian bug #466195).

* Improvements
  * Implemented delay injection (-e inject=SET:delay_enter= and
    -e inject=SET:delay_exit= options).
  * Added -A option for opening output files in append mode

  * Enhanced decoding of getsockopt and setsockopt syscalls for SOL_NETLINK
    level.
  * Enhanced decoding of BPF_MAP_CREATE command of bpf syscall.

    of mq_getsetattr, mq_notify, mq_timedreceive, and mq_timedsend syscalls
    as file descriptors.
  * Added decoding of get_tls syscall on arm.
  * Added -e trace=%pure option for tracing system calls with no arguments that
    never fail.

  * Implemented biarch support for s390x.

  * Fixed open mode flags decoding.
  * Fixed corner cases in handling of strace -ff -ttt logs by strace-log-merge.
  * Error counts that exceed one billion are now printed correctly in call
    summary output.
  * Fixed call summary header for x32 personality.
  * Changes of tracee personalities are reported more reliably.
  * Fixed the case when strace attaches to a tracee being inside exec and its
    first syscall stop is syscall-exit-stop instead of syscall-enter-stop,
    which messed up all the syscall state tracking.
  * Fixed printing of higher 32 bits of the return value for x32 personality.

* Portability
  * A C compiler that supports "for" loop initial declarations is now required.
  * Inability to configure multiple personality support on architectures where
    multiple personalities are supported leads to configuration failure during
    build now.  Use --enable-mpers=check to revert to the old behaviour.
  * Build-time requirement for the mpers support has been lowered from gawk 4
    to gawk 3.
  * Removed incomplete and non-functional support for the CRIS architecture.
