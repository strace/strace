To run a test:
* Run make
* Run resulting executable(s) under strace
* Check strace output and/or program's output and exitcode

To add a new test:
* Add its .c source to this dir
* Add it to "all" and "clean" targets in Makefile
* Add it to .gitignore file

Please spend some time making your testcase understandable.
For example, it may print an explanation how it should be used
(which strace options to use, and what to look for in strace output).

If possible, make it so that your testcase detects error/bug
it is intended to test for, and prints error message and exits with 1
if the bug is detected, instead of relying on user to peruse strace output.
