	instead of sigcontext_struct since glibc v5+ apparently
	plays games with the native OS namespace.
	From David Mosberger-Tang <davidm@AZStarNet.com>.

	* signalent.sh: Make it work for sunos4, linux, and svr4.
	* {sunos4,linux{,/alpha},svr4}/Makefile.in: Make rules correspond
 	to traditional make syntax.  Add signalent.h to files which can

 	unconditionally being rebuilt since it's customized.
	* {sunos4,linux{,/alpha},svr4}/{ioctlent,errnoent,signalent}.h:
 	Use versions built by {ioctlent,errnoent,signaltent}.sh.
  	* sunos4/ioctlent.sh: Work around sprintf troubles with SunOS

	* defs.h (tprintf): Fix typo in non-gcc ansi prototype for tprintf.
	Reported by Thanh Ma <tma@encore.com>.

	* strace.c (cleanup): Send SIGCONT before SIGTERM because Linux
	1.1.62 doesn't continue a traced child when the parent exits.
	Reported by Matt Day <mday@artisoft.com>.

	* system.c [LINUX]: Include netinet/in.h before arpa/inet.h.

	* util.c (printstr): Fix longstanding bug in notating string
	continuation.

	* strace.c [SVR4] (proc_open): Specifically wait for the child the
	child to go into the execve syscall to avoid spurious traces.
	[LINUX] (detach): Conditionalize the status variable.

Sun Dec  4 23:21:42 1994  Rick Sladkey  <jrs@world.std.com>

	* Makefile.in: Add mips arch.
	* acconfig.h (MIPS): Add mips define.
	* configure.in: Add detection of opsys irix5 and arch mips.  Check
	for prctl function.
	Check for sys/sysconfig.h header.
	* defs.h (MAX_ARGS): Bump maximum syscall arguments from 8 to 32.
	* file.c [SVR4]: Include sys/cred.h.
	(access_flags): Update access flags for SGI.
	(sprinttime): Change type of sprinttime argument from unsigned
	long to time_t.
	* process.c [HAVE_PRCTL]: Include sys/prctl.h.
	[HAVE_PRCTL] (prctl_options, sys_prctl): New for SGI.
	(printsiginfo): Conditionally compile SI_TIMER and SI_MESGQ.
	Cast si_band member to long before printing.
	* signal.c (sigact_flags): Add _SA_BSDCALL for SGI.
	(sigprocmaskcmds): Add SIG_SETMASK32 for SGI.
	* strace.c [SVR4] [MIPS]:
	(foobar): New dummy signal handler.
	(main): Install a dummy signal handler in the child before pausing
	to work around an SGI bug in PRSABORT.
	(proc_open): Send a interrupt to the child instead of aborting the
	syscall which doesn't work on Irix5.2.
	* svr4/dummy.h: Add new unfinished SGI syscalls
	(e.g. sys_sysmp, sys_sginap, etc.).  Handle some SGI syscalls like
	existing calls (e.g. sys_ksigaction like sys_sigaction).
	Printargs does the print thing for sys_sethostid.
	* svr4/syscall.h: Declare all new SGI syscalls.
	(SGI_KLUDGE): Define syscall table starting index to be 1 for SGI
	and add it to all subcall entry points.
	(SYS_pgrpsys_subcall, SYS_sigcall_subcall, SYS_context): Don't
	decode as subcalls on MIPS. Instead, use the normal syscalls.
	* svr4/syscallent.h [MIPS]: Lead syscall table with a dummy entry
	since SGI syscall numbers are off by one.
	[MIPS] (sys_pgrpsys): Rename to sys_setpgrp on SGI.
	[MIPS] (sys_xenix): Rename to sys_syssgi on SGI.
	[MIPS] (sys_sysmachine): Rename to sys_sysmips on SGI.
	[MIPS]: Conditionalize SVR4 extension into SGI and Solaris classes.
	* syscall.c (dumpio): Validate descriptor against MAX_QUALS.
	[HAVE_PR_SYSCALL] (syscall): Conditionalize SYS_vfork.
	[MIPS] (syscall): Add SGI section for decoding u_error and u_rval.
	Add workaround for broken SGI pr_sysarg on syscall entry.
	[SVR4] (syscall): Conditionalize subcall decoding for
	SYS_ptrpsys_subcall, SYS_sigcall_subcall and SYS_context_subcall.
	[SVR4] [MIPS] (getrval2): Handle SGI.
	* syscallent.sh: Dork the sed line to be choosier about SYS_ lines.
	* system.c [HAVE_SYSCONFIG_H]: Include sys/sysconfig.h.
	[MIPS] (syssgi_options, sys_syssgi): New for SGI.
