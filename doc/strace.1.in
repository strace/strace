.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "strace command" "" "\fLstrace\fR command"
.LP
In the simplest case
.B strace
runs the specified
.I command
until it exits.
It intercepts and records the system calls which are called
by a process and the signals which are received by a process.
The name of each system call, its arguments and its return value
are printed on standard error or to the file specified with the
.B \-o
option.
.LP
.B strace
is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.
System administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find
it invaluable for solving problems with
programs for which the source is not readily available since
they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them.
Students, hackers and the overly-curious will find that
a great deal can be learned about a system and its system calls by
tracing even ordinary programs.  And programmers will find that
since system calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
interface, a close examination of this boundary is very
useful for bug isolation, sanity checking and
attempting to capture race conditions.
.LP
Each line in the trace contains the system call name, followed
by its arguments in parentheses and its return value.
An example from stracing the command "cat /dev/null" is:
.CW
open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY) = 3
.CE
Errors (typically a return value of \-1) have the errno symbol
and error string appended.
.CW
open("/foo/bar", O_RDONLY) = \-1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
.CE
Signals are printed as signal symbol and decoded siginfo structure.
An excerpt from stracing and interrupting the command "sleep 666" is:
.CW
sigsuspend([] <unfinished ...>
--- SIGINT {si_signo=SIGINT, si_code=SI_USER, si_pid=...} ---
+++ killed by SIGINT +++
.CE
If a system call is being executed and meanwhile another one is being called
from a different thread/process then
.B strace
will try to preserve the order of those events and mark the ongoing call as
being
.IR unfinished .
When the call returns it will be marked as
.IR resumed .
.CW
[pid 28772] select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL <unfinished ...>
[pid 28779] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148, 939977000}) = 0
[pid 28772] <... select resumed> )      = 1 (in [3])
.CE
Interruption of a (restartable) system call by a signal delivery is processed
differently as kernel terminates the system call and also arranges its
immediate reexecution after the signal handler completes.
.CW
read(0, 0x7ffff72cf5cf, 1)              = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
--- SIGALRM ... ---
rt_sigreturn(0xe)                       = 0
read(0, "", 1)                          = 0
.CE
Arguments are printed in symbolic form with passion.
This example shows the shell performing ">>xyzzy" output redirection:
.CW
open("xyzzy", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 3
.CE
Here, the second and the third argument of
.BR open (2)
are decoded by breaking down the
flag argument into its three bitwise-OR constituents and printing the
mode value in octal by tradition.  Where the traditional or native
usage differs from ANSI or POSIX, the latter forms are preferred.
In some cases,
.B strace
output is proven to be more readable than the source.
.LP
Structure pointers are dereferenced and the members are displayed
as appropriate.  In most cases, arguments are formatted in the most C-like
fashion possible.
For example, the essence of the command "ls \-l /dev/null" is captured as:
.CW
lstat("/dev/null", {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666, st_rdev=makedev(0x1, 0x3), ...}) = 0
.CE
Notice how the 'struct stat' argument is dereferenced and how each member is
displayed symbolically.  In particular, observe how the
.B st_mode
member is carefully decoded into a bitwise-OR of symbolic and numeric values.
Also notice in this example that the first argument to
.BR lstat (2)
is an input to the system call and the second argument is an output.
Since output arguments are not modified if the system call fails, arguments may
not always be dereferenced.  For example, retrying the "ls \-l" example
with a non-existent file produces the following line:
.CW
lstat("/foo/bar", 0xb004) = \-1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
.CE
In this case the porch light is on but nobody is home.
.LP
Syscalls unknown to
.B strace
are printed raw, with the unknown system call number printed in hexadecimal form
and prefixed with "syscall_":
.CW
syscall_0xbad(0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5, 0x6) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
.CE
.LP
Character pointers are dereferenced and printed as C strings.
Non-printing characters in strings are normally represented by
ordinary C escape codes.
Only the first
.I strsize
(32 by default) bytes of strings are printed;
longer strings have an ellipsis appended following the closing quote.
Here is a line from "ls \-l" where the
.BR getpwuid (3)
library routine is reading the password file:
.CW
read(3, "root::0:0:System Administrator:/"..., 1024) = 422
.CE
While structures are annotated using curly braces, simple pointers
and arrays are printed using square brackets with commas separating
elements.  Here is an example from the command
.BR id (1)
on a system with supplementary group ids:
.CW
getgroups(32, [100, 0]) = 2
.CE
On the other hand, bit-sets are also shown using square brackets,
but set elements are separated only by a space.
Here is the shell, preparing to execute an external command:
.CW
sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD TTOU], []) = 0
.CE
Here, the second argument is a bit-set of two signals,
.BR SIGCHLD " and " SIGTTOU .
In some cases, the bit-set is so full that printing out the unset
elements is more valuable.  In that case, the bit-set is prefixed by
a tilde like this:
.CW
sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, ~[], NULL) = 0
.CE
Here, the second argument represents the full set of all signals.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS General
.TP 12
.BI "\-e " expr
A qualifying expression which modifies which events to trace
or how to trace them.  The format of the expression is:
.RS 15
.IP
[\,\fIqualifier\/\fB=\fR][\fB!\fR]\,\fIvalue\/\fR[\fB,\fR\,\fIvalue\/\fR]...
.RE
.IP
where
.I qualifier
is one of
.BR trace " (or " t ),
.BR abbrev " (or " a ),
.BR verbose " (or " v ),
.BR raw " (or " x ),
.BR signal " (or " signals " or " s ),
.BR read " (or " reads " or " r ),
.BR write " (or " writes " or " w ),
.BR fault ,
.BR inject ,
.BR status ,
.BR quiet " (or " silent " or " silence " or " q ),
.BR decode\-fds " (or " decode\-fd ),
or
.BR kvm ,
and
.I value
is a qualifier-dependent symbol or number.  The default
qualifier is
.BR trace .
Using an exclamation mark negates the set of values.  For example,
.BR \-e "\ " open
means literally
.BR \-e "\ " trace = open
which in turn means trace only the
.B open
system call.  By contrast,
.BR \-e "\ " trace "=!" open
means to trace every system call except
.BR open .
In addition, the special values
.B all
and
.B none
have the obvious meanings.
.IP
Note that some shells use the exclamation point for history
expansion even inside quoted arguments.  If so, you must escape
the exclamation point with a backslash.
.SS Startup
.TP 12
\fB\-E\ \fIvar\fR=\,\fIval\fR
.TQ
.BR "\-\-env" = \fIvar\fR = \fIval\fR
Run command with
.IR var = val
in its list of environment variables.
.TP
.BI "\-E " var
.TQ
.BR "\-\-env" = \fIvar\fR
Remove
.IR var
from the inherited list of environment variables before passing it on to
the command.
.TP
.BI "\-p " pid
.TQ
.BR "\-\-attach" = \fIpid\fR
Attach to the process with the process
.SM ID
.I pid
and begin tracing.
The trace may be terminated
at any time by a keyboard interrupt signal
.RB ( CTRL\-C ).
.B strace
will respond by detaching itself from the traced process(es)
leaving it (them) to continue running.
Multiple
.B \-p
options can be used to attach to many processes in addition to
.I command
(which is optional if at least one
.B \-p
option is given).
.B \-p
"`pidof PROG`" syntax is supported.
.TP
.BI "\-u " username
.TQ
.BR "\-\-user" = \fIusername\fR
Run command with the user \s-1ID\s0, group \s-2ID\s0, and
supplementary groups of
.IR username .
This option is only useful when running as root and enables the
correct execution of setuid and/or setgid binaries.
Unless this option is used setuid and setgid programs are executed
without effective privileges.
.SS Tracing
.TP 12
.BI "\-b " syscall
.TQ
.BR "\-\-detach\-on" = \fIsyscall\fR
If specified syscall is reached, detach from traced process.
Currently, only
.BR execve (2)
syscall is supported.  This option is useful if you want to trace
multi-threaded process and therefore require
.BR \-f ,
but don't want to trace its (potentially very complex) children.
.TP
.B \-D
.TQ
.B \-\-daemonize
.TQ
.BR \-\-daemonize = grandchild
Run tracer process as a grandchild, not as the parent of the
tracee.  This reduces the visible effect of
.B strace
by keeping the tracee a direct child of the calling process.
.TP
.B \-DD
.TQ
.BR \-\-daemonize = pgroup
.TQ
.BR \-\-daemonize = pgrp
Run tracer process as tracee's grandchild in a separate process group.
In addition to reduction of the visible effect of
.BR strace ,
it also avoids killing of
.B strace
with
.BR kill (2)
issued to the whole process group.
.TP
.B \-DDD
.TQ
.BR \-\-daemonize = session
Run tracer process as tracee's grandchild in a separate session
("true daemonisation").
In addition to reduction of the visible effect of
.BR strace ,
it also avoids killing of
.B strace
upon session termination.
.TP
.B \-f
.TQ
.BR \-\-follow\-forks
Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced
processes as a result of the
.BR fork (2),
.BR vfork (2)
and
.BR clone (2)
system calls.  Note that
.B \-p
.I PID
.B \-f
will attach all threads of process
.I PID
if it is multi-threaded, not only thread with
.IR thread_id " = " PID .
.TP
.B \-\-output\-separately
If the
.BR \-\-output = \fIfilename\fR
option is in effect, each processes trace is written to
.IR filename . pid
where
.I pid
is the numeric process id of each process.
.TP
.B \-ff
.TQ
.B \-\-follow\-forks \-\-output\-separately
Combine the effects of
.B \-\-follow\-forks
and
.B \-\-output\-separately
options.
This is incompatible with
.BR \-c ,
since no per-process counts are kept.
.IP
One might want to consider using
.BR strace-log-merge (1)
to obtain a combined strace log view.
.TP
.BI "\-I " interruptible

\fB\-e\ trace\fR=\,\fIsyscall_set\fR
.TQ
\fB\-\-trace\fR=\,\fIsyscall_set\fR
Trace only the specified set of system calls.
.I syscall_set
is defined as
[\fB!\fR]\,\fIvalue\fR[\fB,\fR\,\fIvalue\/\fR],
and
.I value
can be one of the following:
.RS
.TP 13
.I syscall
Trace specific syscall, specified by its name (but see
.BR NOTES ).
.TP
.BI ? value
Question mark before the syscall qualification allows suppression of error
in case no syscalls matched the qualification provided.
.TP
.BI / regex
Trace only those system calls that match the
.IR regex .
You can use
.B POSIX
Extended Regular Expression syntax (see
.BR regex (7)).
.TP
.IB syscall @64
Trace
.I syscall
only for the 64-bit personality.
.TP
.IB syscall @32
Trace
.I syscall
only for the 32-bit personality.
.TP
.IB syscall @x32
Trace
.I syscall
only for the 32-on-64-bit personality.
.TP
.B %file
.TQ
.BR file
Trace all system calls which take a file name as an argument.  You
can think of this as an abbreviation for
.BR "\-e\ trace" = open , stat , chmod , unlink ,...
which is useful to seeing what files the process is referencing.
Furthermore, using the abbreviation will ensure that you don't
accidentally forget to include a call like
.BR lstat (2)
in the list.  Betchya woulda forgot that one.

syscalls.
.RE
.IP
The
.B \-c
option is useful for determining which system calls might be useful
to trace.  For example,
.BR trace = open,close,read,write
means to only
trace those four system calls.  Be careful when making inferences
about the user/kernel boundary if only a subset of system calls
are being monitored.  The default is
.BR trace = all .
.TP
\fB\-e\ signal\fR=\,\fIset\fR
.TQ
\fB\-\-signal\fR=\,\fIset\fR
Trace only the specified subset of signals.  The default is
.BR signal = all .
For example,
.BR signal "=!" SIGIO
(or
.BR signal "=!" io )
causes
.B SIGIO
signals not to be traced.
.TP
\fB\-e\ status\fR=\,\fIset\fR
.TQ
\fB\-\-status\fR=\,\fIset\fR
Print only system calls with the specified return status.  The default is
.BR status = all .
When using the
.B status
qualifier, because
.B strace
waits for system calls to return before deciding whether they should be printed
or not, the traditional order of events may not be preserved anymore.  If two
system calls are executed by concurrent threads,
.B strace
will first print both the entry and exit of the first system call to exit,
regardless of their respective entry time.  The entry and exit of the second
system call to exit will be printed afterwards.  Here is an example when
.BR select (2)
is called, but a different thread calls
.BR clock_gettime (2)
before
.BR select (2)
finishes:
.CW
[pid 28779] 1130322148.939977 clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148, 939977000}) = 0
[pid 28772] 1130322148.438139 select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL) = 1 (in [3])
.CE

.IP
If :\fBerror\fR=\,\fIerrno\/\fR option is specified,
a fault is injected into a syscall invocation:
the syscall number is replaced by -1 which corresponds to an invalid syscall
(unless a syscall is specified with :\fBsyscall=\fR option),
and the error code is specified using a symbolic
.I errno
value like
.B ENOSYS
or a numeric value within 1..4095 range.

If :\fBretval\fR=\,\fIvalue\/\fR option is specified,
success injection is performed: the syscall number is replaced by -1,
but a bogus success value is returned to the callee.
.IP
If :\fBsignal\fR=\,\fIsig\/\fR option is specified with either a symbolic value
like
.B SIGSEGV
or a numeric value within 1..\fBSIGRTMAX\fR range,
that signal is delivered on entering every syscall specified by the
.IR set .
.IP
If :\fBdelay_enter\fR=\,\fIdelay\/\fR or :\fBdelay_exit\fR=\,\fIdelay\/\fR
options are specified, delay injection is performed: the tracee is delayed
by time period specified by
.IR delay
on entering or exiting the syscall, respectively.
The format of
.I delay
specification is described in section
.IR "Time specification format description".
.IP
If :\fBpoke_enter\fR=\fI@argN=DATAN,@argM=DATAM...\fR

:\fBdelay_enter\fR=\,\fIdelay\/\fR,
:\fBdelay_exit\fR=\,\fIdelay\/\fR or

If
:\fBsignal\fR=\,\fIsig\/\fR
option is specified together with
:\fBerror\fR=\,\fIerrno\/\fR or :\fBretval\fR=\,\fIvalue\/\fR,
then both injection of a fault or success and signal delivery are performed.
.IP
if :\fBsyscall\fR=\fIsyscall\fR option is specified, the corresponding syscall
with no side effects is injected instead of -1.
Currently, only "pure" (see

Accounting of syscalls that are subject to injection

Multiple injection expressions for the same syscall are evaluated in the order

ioctl(-1, EVIOCGID, NULL)         = 42 (INJECTED)
ioctl(-1, EVIOCGID, NULL)         = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor)
.CE
Here, the first injection specification injects 42 to ioctl calls 3 thorugh 9;
however, calls 4, 5, 6, and 8 are overridden by the following injection
specifications: in case of calls 4 and 6 the injection was cancelled by the
\fB\-e inject\fR=\fBioctl\fR:\fBwhen\fR=2+2:\fBnone\fR specification,
and the calls 5 and 8 were mangled in accordance with the
\fB\-e fault\fR=\fBioctl\fR:\fBwhen\fR=5..9+3 specification
that also has taken precedence over the
,B none
injection action in the 8th call.
.IP
Specification of syscall injection can be combined

optionally followed by one of the following suffices that specify
the unit of time:
.B s
(seconds),
.B ms

.B us
(microseconds), or

(nanoseconds).
If no suffix is specified, the value is interpreted as microseconds.
.PP
The described format is used for
.BR \-O ", " "\-e inject" = delay_enter ", and " "\-e inject" = delay_exit
options.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When
.I command
exits,
.B strace
exits with the same exit status.
If
.I command
is terminated by a signal,
.B strace
terminates itself with the same signal, so that
.B strace
can be used as a wrapper process transparent to the invoking parent process.
Note that parent-child relationship (signal stop notifications,
.BR getppid (2)
value, etc) between traced process and its parent are not preserved
unless
.B \-D
is used.
.LP
When using
.B \-p
without a
.IR command ,
the exit status of
.B strace
is zero unless no processes has been attached or there was an unexpected error
in doing the tracing.
.SH "SETUID INSTALLATION"
If
.B strace
is installed setuid to root then the invoking user will be able to
attach to and trace processes owned by any user.
In addition setuid and setgid programs will be executed and traced
with the correct effective privileges.
Since only users trusted with full root privileges should be allowed
to do these things,
it only makes sense to install
.B strace
as setuid to root when the users who can execute it are restricted
to those users who have this trust.
For example, it makes sense to install a special version of
.B strace
with mode 'rwsr-xr--', user
.B root
and group
.BR trace ,
where members of the
.B trace
group are trusted users.
If you do use this feature, please remember to install
a regular non-setuid version of
.B strace
for ordinary users to use.

then decoding of non-native 32-bit binaries is not implemented at all
or not applicable.
.PP
Likewise, if the output contains neither
.B mx32-mpers
nor
.BR no-mx32-mpers ,
then decoding of non-native 32-on-64-bit binaries is not implemented at all
or not applicable.
.SH NOTES
It is a pity that so much tracing clutter is produced by systems
employing shared libraries.
.LP
It is instructive to think about system call inputs and outputs
as data-flow across the user/kernel boundary.  Because user-space
and kernel-space are separate and address-protected, it is
sometimes possible to make deductive inferences about process
behavior using inputs and outputs as propositions.
.LP
In some cases, a system call will differ from the documented behavior
or have a different name.  For example, the
.BR faccessat (2)
system call does not have
.I flags
argument, and the
.BR setrlimit (2)
library function uses
.BR prlimit64 (2)
system call on modern (2.6.38+) kernels.  These
discrepancies are normal but idiosyncratic characteristics of the
system call interface and are accounted for by C library wrapper
functions.
.LP
Some system calls have different names in different architectures and
personalities.  In these cases, system call filtering and printing
uses the names that match corresponding
.BR __NR_ *
kernel macros of the tracee's architecture and personality.
There are two exceptions from this general rule:
.BR arm_fadvise64_64 (2)
ARM syscall and
.BR xtensa_fadvise64_64 (2)
Xtensa syscall are filtered and printed as
.BR fadvise64_64 (2).
.LP
On x32, syscalls that are intended to be used by 64-bit processes and not x32
ones (for example,
.BR readv (2),
that has syscall number 19 on x86_64, with its x32 counterpart has syscall
number 515), but called with
.B __X32_SYSCALL_BIT
flag being set, are designated with
.B "#64"
suffix.
.LP
On some platforms a process that is attached to with the
.B \-p
option may observe a spurious
.B EINTR
return from the current system call that is not restartable.
(Ideally, all system calls should be restarted on
.B strace
attach, making the attach invisible
to the traced process, but a few system calls aren't.
Arguably, every instance of such behavior is a kernel bug.)
This may have an unpredictable effect on the process
if the process takes no action to restart the system call.
.LP
As
.B strace
executes the specified
.I command
directly and does not employ a shell for that, scripts without shebang
that usually run just fine when invoked by shell fail to execute with
.B ENOEXEC
error.
It is advisable to manually supply a shell as a
.I command
with the script as its argument.
.SH BUGS
Programs that use the
.I setuid
bit do not have
effective user
.SM ID
privileges while being traced.
.LP
A traced process runs slowly (but check out the
.B \-\-seccomp\-bpf
option).
.LP
Traced processes which are descended from
.I command
may be left running after an interrupt signal
.RB ( CTRL\-C ).
.SH HISTORY
The original
.B strace
was written by Paul Kranenburg
for SunOS and was inspired by its
.B trace
utility.
The SunOS version of
.B strace
was ported to Linux and enhanced
by Branko Lankester, who also wrote the Linux kernel support.
Even though Paul released
.B strace
2.5 in 1992,
Branko's work was based on Paul's
.B strace
1.5 release from 1991.
In 1993, Rick Sladkey merged
.B strace
2.5 for SunOS and the second release of
.B strace
for Linux, added many of the features of
.BR truss (1)
from SVR4, and produced an
.B strace
that worked on both platforms.  In 1994 Rick ported
.B strace
to SVR4 and Solaris and wrote the
automatic configuration support.  In 1995 he ported
.B strace
to Irix
and tired of writing about himself in the third person.
.PP
Beginning with 1996,
.B strace
was maintained by Wichert Akkerman.
During his tenure,
.B strace
development migrated to CVS; ports to FreeBSD and many architectures on Linux
(including ARM, IA-64, MIPS, PA-RISC, PowerPC, s390, SPARC) were introduced.
In 2002, the burden of
.B strace
maintainership was transferred to Roland McGrath.
Since then,
.B strace
gained support for several new Linux architectures (AMD64, s390x, SuperH),
bi-architecture support for some of them, and received numerous additions and
improvements in syscalls decoders on Linux;
.B strace
development migrated to
.B git
during that period.
Since 2009,
.B strace
is actively maintained by Dmitry Levin.
.B strace
gained support for AArch64, ARC, AVR32, Blackfin, Meta, Nios II, OpenRISC 1000,
RISC-V, Tile/TileGx, Xtensa architectures since that time.
In 2012, unmaintained and apparently broken support for non-Linux operating
systems was removed.
Also, in 2012
.B strace
gained support for path tracing and file descriptor path decoding.
In 2014, support for stack traces printing was added.
In 2016, syscall fault injection was implemented.
