.SH DESCRIPTION
.B asinfo
provides information about various aspects of system calls across architectures
using
.B strace
knowledge base.

In the simplest
case it provides mapping from system call name to number and reverse.
The main advantage of tool is it can work in single/multi arch modes with
the opportunity to show discrepancies in system call characteristics.
Also, the single arch mode allows program to take a guess about the
current architecture and ABI, if they are not specified. Furthermore,
.B asinfo
provides convenient filtering for selecting system calls.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Architecture parameters"
.TP 7
.BI "\-\-set\-arch " arch
Specify architecture/architectures manually. The format of the
.I arch
expression is:
.RS 9
.IP
\fIarch1\/\fR[\fB,\fIarch2\/\fR]...
.RE
.IP
.TP
.B \-\-get\-arch
Select achitecture based on the current machine.
.TP
.B \-\-list-arch
Print out all supported architectures.
Combined use with any ABI option is permitted.
.SS "ABI parameters"
.TP 7
.BI "\-\-set\-abi " abi
Specify ABI/ABIs manually. The format of the experession is:
.RS 9
.IP
\fIabi1\/\fR[\fB,\fIabi2\/\fR]...
.RE
.IP
.IP
Note that ABI should be selected for each corresponding architecture.
In addition, the special value
.B all
allows to choose all ABIs for the respective architecture.
.TP
.B "\-\-list\-abi "
Select all ABIs for the chosen architecture/architectures.
.IP
If ABI parameters are not used and only single architecture is selected, tool
will take a guess about ABI based on the strace package build.
.SS "System call parameters"
.TP 7
.BI "\-\-get\-sname " expr
Select system calls that satisfy a filtering expression
.I
expr
and print out name of system calls and numbers for each architecture/ABI.
.TP
.BI "\-\-get\-snum " expr
Select system calls that satisfy a filtering expression
.I
expr
and print out number of system calls and names for each architecture/ABI.
.TP
.B \-\-nargs
Switch the second output system call characteristic to number of arguments.
.SS Output formatting
.TP 7
.B "\-\-raw"
Reset alignment and remove titles, use ';' as a delimiter.
.SS Miscellaneous
.TP 7
.B \-h
Print the help summary.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.

.SH "FILTERING EXPRESSION"
A filtering expression is a pattern that describes a set of syscall names,
syscall numbers, and syscall group. The format of the expression is:
.RS 2
.IP
[\fB!\fR][\fB?\fR]\,\fIvalue1\/\fR[\fB,\fR[\fB?\fR]\,\fIvalue2\/\fR]...
.RE
.LP
where
.I value
is a symbol or number. Using an exclamation mark negates the set of values.
For example,
.BR \fIvalue\fR = write
means print strictly the write system call.  By contrast,
.BR \fIvalue\fR = !write
means to dump every system call except write. Question mark before the
syscall qualification allows suppression of error in case no syscalls matched
the qualification provided, that can be particularly useful in multiarch mode,
when system call is not presented in all selected architectures. In addition,
the special values
.B all
and
.B none
have the obvious meanings.
.LP
Note that some shells use the exclamation point for history
expansion even inside quoted arguments.  If so, you must escape
the exclamation point with a backslash.
.SS "Strict match"
.TP 7
.B \fIvalue\fR=\,\fIset\fR
Print out only the specified set of system calls. For example,
.BR \fIvalue\fR = open,close,read,write
means to only show those four system calls.
.SS "Regex match"
.TP 7
.B \fIvalue\fR=/\,\fIregex\fR
Show only those system calls that match the
.IR regex .
You can use
.B POSIX
Extended Regular Expression syntax (see
.BR regex (7)).
.SS "Class match"
.TP 7
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %file
.TQ
.BR \fIvalue\fR  = file " (deprecated)"
Show all system calls which take a file name as an argument.  You
can think of this as an abbreviation for
.BR \fIvalue\fR = open,stat,chmod,unlink,...
Furthermore, using the abbreviation will ensure that you don't
accidentally forget to include a call like
.B lstat
in the list.
.PP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %process
.TQ
.BR \fIvalue\fR = process " (deprecated)"
Show all system calls which involve process management.
.PP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %network
.TQ
.BR \fIvalue\fR = network " (deprecated)"
Show all the network related system calls.
.PP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %signal
.TQ
.BR \fIvalue\fR = signal " (deprecated)"
Show all signal related system calls.
.PP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %ipc
.TQ
.BR \fIvalue\fR = ipc " (deprecated)"
Show all IPC related system calls.
.PP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %desc
.TQ
.BR \fIvalue\fR = desc " (deprecated)"
Show all file descriptor related system calls.
.PP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %memory
.TQ
.BR \fIvalue\fR = memory " (deprecated)"
Show all memory mapping related system calls.
.TP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %stat
Show stat syscall variants.
.TP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %lstat
Show lstat syscall variants.
.TP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %fstat
Show fstat and fstatat syscall variants.
.TP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %%stat
Show syscalls used for requesting file status (stat, lstat, fstat, fstatat,
statx, and their variants).
.TP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %statfs
Show statfs, statfs64, statvfs, osf_statfs, and osf_statfs64 system calls.
The same effect can be achieved with
.BR \fIvalue\fR = /^(.*_)?statv?fs
regular expression.
.TP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %fstatfs
Show fstatfs, fstatfs64, fstatvfs, osf_fstatfs, and osf_fstatfs64 system calls.
The same effect can be achieved with
.BR \fIvalue\fR = /fstatv?fs
regular expression.
.TP
.BR \fIvalue\fR = %%statfs
Show syscalls related to file system statistics (statfs-like, fstatfs-like,
and ustat).  The same effect can be achieved with
.BR \fIvalue\fR = /statv?fs|fsstat|ustat
regular expression.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
On success,
.B asinfo
returns 0. Otherwise, in case of wrong input or no matches found, 1.

.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Problems with
.B asinfo
should be reported to the
.B strace
mailing list at <strace-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.
